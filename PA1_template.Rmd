#### Loading and Preprocessing the data
unzip the file, get "activity.csv"

	unzip("activity.zip")
Reading the data into 'activity', and show it by summary and review first few data

	activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
show data in "str" format

	str(activity)
the "str" result is,

	'data.frame':	17568 obs. of  3 variables:
 	$ steps   : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
	$ date    : Factor w/ 61 levels "2012-10-01","2012-10-02",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 	$ interval: int  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ...
detect what the data look like,

	head(activity)
the "head" result is,

	  steps       date interval
	1    NA 2012-10-01        0
	2    NA 2012-10-01        5
	3    NA 2012-10-01       10
	4    NA 2012-10-01       15
	5    NA 2012-10-01       20
	6    NA 2012-10-01       25
finally, use summary to picture the data frame

	summary(activity)
the "summary" result is,

     steps                date          interval
	 Min.   :  0.00   2012-10-01:  288   Min.   :   0.0
 	 1st Qu.:  0.00   2012-10-02:  288   1st Qu.: 588.8
 	 Median :  0.00   2012-10-03:  288   Median :1177.5
	 Mean   : 37.38   2012-10-04:  288   Mean   :1177.5
	 3rd Qu.: 12.00   2012-10-05:  288   3rd Qu.:1766.2
	 Max.   :806.00   2012-10-06:  288   Max.   :2355.0
	 NA's   :2304     (Other)   :15840
Refine the date column of "activity".

		> library(lubridate)
		> activity$date <- ymd(activity$date)
		> str(activity)

the result is,

	'data.frame':	17568 obs. of  3 variables:
 	$ steps   : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
 	$ date    : POSIXct, format: "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" ...
 	$ interval: int  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ...

#### What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day

		steps_by_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity, sum)
try to look at the "steps_by_day"

		> head(steps_by_day)
	    	    date steps
		1 2012-10-02   126
		2 2012-10-03 11352
		3 2012-10-04 12116
		4 2012-10-05 13294
		5 2012-10-06 15420
		6 2012-10-07 11015
2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

		hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col="red", xlab="Num of Steps")

3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

		> mean_steps <- mean(steps_by_day$steps)
		> mean_steps
		[1] 10766.19
		> median_steps <- median(steps_by_day$steps)
		> median_steps
		[1] 10765

####What is the average daily activity pattern?
1. Make a time series plot (i.e. 𝚝𝚢𝚙𝚎 = "𝚕") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

		> steps_by_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity, mean)
		> plot(steps_by_interval$interval,steps_by_interval$steps, type="l", 		xlab="Interval", ylab="Num of Steps",main="Average Number of Steps per Day by Interval")
2. Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

		> max_interval <- steps_by_interval[which.max(steps_by_interval$steps), 1]
		>
		> max_interval
		[1] 835
#### Imputing missing values
1. Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset

		> incomplete <- sum(!complete.cases(activity)
		> incomplete
		[1] 2304

2. Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset.
Replace the NA value with the average value,
3. Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

		> complete_activity <- transform(activity, steps = ifelse(is.na(activity$steps), 		steps_by_interval$steps[match(activity$interval, steps_by_interval$interval)], activity$steps))
From the following result, it is clearly that replace is successful.

		> str(complete_activity)
		'data.frame':	17568 obs. of  3 variables:
		 $ steps   : int  91 18 7 8 4 111 28 46 0 78 ...
		 $ date    : POSIXct, format: "2012-10-01" "2012-10-01" ...
		 $ interval: int  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ...
		> summary(complete_activity)
		     steps              date               interval
		 Min.   :    0.0   Min.   :2012-10-01   Min.   :   0.0
		 1st Qu.:    0.0   1st Qu.:2012-10-16   1st Qu.: 588.8
		 Median :    0.0   Median :2012-10-31   Median :1177.5
		 Mean   :  292.3   Mean   :2012-10-31   Mean   :1177.5
		 3rd Qu.:   43.0   3rd Qu.:2012-11-15   3rd Qu.:1766.2
		 Max.   :10927.0   Max.   :2012-11-30   Max.   :2355.0

4. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

		hist(steps_by_day_i$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col = "green", xlab = "Num of Steps")
		hist(steps_by_day$steps, main = paste("Total Steps Each Day"), col = "red", xlab = "Num of Steps", add = T)
		legend("topright", c("Modified", "Original"), col = c("green", "red"), lwd = 10)
Calculate the new dataset mean & median

		> complete_mean <- mean(steps_by_day_i$steps)
		> complete_mean
		[1] 10766.19
		> complete_median <- median(steps_by_day_i$steps)
		> complete_median
		[1] 10766.19
Calcute the difference between the new dataset and old one

		> mean_diff <- complete_mean - mean_steps
		> mean_diff
		[1] 0
		> median_diff <- complete_median - median_steps
		> median_diff
		[1] 1.188679
Calcute the total diffierence

		> total_diff <- sum(steps_by_day_i$steps) - sum(steps_by_day$steps)
		> total_diff
		[1] 86129.51

####Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?


		> week_days <- c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday")
		> complete_activity$work_days = as.factor(ifelse(is.element(weekdays(as.Date(complete_activity$date)), week_days), "WeekDay", "Weekend"))
		> summary(complete_activity)
	     steps                date          interval        work_days
	 Min.   :  0.00   2012-10-01:  288   Min.   :   0.0   WeekDay:12960
	 1st Qu.:  0.00   2012-10-02:  288   1st Qu.: 588.8   Weekend: 4608
	 Median :  0.00   2012-10-03:  288   Median :1177.5
	 Mean   : 37.38   2012-10-04:  288   Mean   :1177.5
	 3rd Qu.: 27.00   2012-10-05:  288   3rd Qu.:1766.2
	 Max.   :806.00   2012-10-06:  288   Max.   :2355.0
	                  (Other)   :15840
		> steps_by_interval_i <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + work_days, complete_activity, mean)
		> library(lattice)
